On Linux, if you are not able to open the Serial Monitor, then run the following command :

$ sudo chown <username> <Name of the port>

For example
$ sudo chown axai /dev/ttyACM0

Running this command will open the Serial Monitor.

In my case, /dev/ttyACM0 was the name of the port. On Windows, we see that it is usually COMx (Ex. COM3).
